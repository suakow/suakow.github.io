It changes business strategies, policies as well as the behaviour of your teams. If your company embarks on integrating AI, it needs to do what is relevant and what you want it for. We developed impactful AI applications that are accurate, taking into account the factors that drive the predictions and relating it to domain expertise. We help you integrate AI innovations in your services or products.\nExplainable AI | Generative AI & Large Language Models | Physics-Informed Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoaching & mentoring\nData and AI will change your business and your way of working. Not everyone is immediately ready for this. We teach, coach and mentor professionals who require a better understanding of data and artificial intelligence, making them comfortable and topic-specialists. We offer in-company on-the-job coaching, working side-by-side with your team to explore how AI can impact your line of business.\nOne-the-job coaching for individuals and teams | Challenge-based learning | Technical deep-dives for experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasterclasses & public speaking\nWe provide masterclasses on topics related to data & AI, ranging from introductory lectures to more advanced deep-dives. For larger audiences, we create workshops or provide keynotes such that professionals at all levels can obtain a better understanding of data and AI.\nKeynote speeches | Masterclasses for management and executives | Inspirational lectures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“As a data architect and AI expert I can help you create sustainable change with digital technologies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout me\nDr Daniel Kapitan (1973) is a well-rounded data scientist and strategic advisor with years of experience in the field of data, machine learning and digital transformation. His knowledge can help companies to identify how to use AI, and how to integrate this into business processes, roles, and day-to-day operations. He aims to create sustainable change in organizations by systematically engineering data that is required for new AI applications.\nWith a PhD in physics from University of Oxford and currently Fellow at the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI), Daniel has a strong scientific grounding in the field. He speaks authoritatively about data-driven transformation programs, reducing complexity to ‘informed simplicity’ for even the most challenging data projects. By combining data and AI know-how with industry expertise, he is capable of bringing about end-to-end business transformation for mid-sized companies, government organizations and scale-ups.\nDaniel starts when organizations are ready to embark on their digital journey, and finishes when people are enabled to continue to work with data and AI by themselves.\n\nRoles\nDaniel works as an advisor, architect, lecturer, applied researcher and mentor. He is one of the few specialists in the Netherlands who has the unique combination of corporate experience, scientific research and executive education. Through these various roles he aims to apply ‘AI for good’. He lectures on data and AI, publishes regularly and is an active member of the Data Sharing Coalition to foster data solidarity and secure data sharing for tackling societal issues.\n\n\nAreas of expertise\nExplainable AI, physics-informed machine learning, data-centric AI, data architecture, federated learning, knowledge science, data commons.\n\n\nIndustry focus\nHealthcare, public sector, OEMs and scale-ups for which data and AI are a core element of their strategy.\n\n\nContact details\nemail: daniel@kapitan.net \n\n\n\n\nBook an appointment"
